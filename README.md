# Rust Neural Networks
A Rust library that provides simple reinforcement learning and basic double deep Q learning, using the GPU. 

## Usage

### Rust side
It is a library. I may write a documentation someday.
You may try the MNIST example by running
```bash
cargo run --example simple_mnist --release
```
### Python example
To run the Python example, once in the python_example repository run
```bash
source .env/bin/activate
python main.py
```
